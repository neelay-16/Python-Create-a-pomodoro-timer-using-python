# Pomodoro Timer with Python and Tkinter
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application created using Python and Tkinter. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

# Features

1. Start a Pomodoro session: Click the "Start Pomodoro" button to begin a 25-minute work session.
2. Stop the Pomodoro session: Click the "Stop Pomodoro" button to stop the current Pomodoro session.
3. Sessions and breaks: The timer alternates between work sessions and short breaks, with a long break after completing a set number of work sessions.
4. Visual cues: The timer displays the current session type (Work Time, Short Break Time, Long Break Time) and the time remaining in that session.
5. Session completion: When a session or break is complete, the timer label changes to "Session Complete!" for a few seconds to provide visual feedback.

This line imports the time module, which is used for dealing with time-related functions.

Initializing a flag pomodoro_active to False, which will be used to control the Pomodoro timer.

This function is called when the "Start Pomodoro" button is clicked. It sets up Pomodoro session durations, starts a loop to manage Pomodoro sessions, and updates the timer label accordingly.

This function is called when the "Stop Pomodoro" button is clicked. It stops the Pomodoro timer and updates the timer label to indicate that the Pomodoro session has been stopped.

This function is used for the actual countdown timer. It updates the timer label with the time remaining for the current session type (e.g., work time, short break time) and uses a loop to decrement the time. When the time is up, it updates the label and waits for a few seconds before clearing it.

'work_time', 'short_break_time', and 'long_break_time' are set to the durations (in seconds) for the work session, short break, and long break, respectively.
'num_work_sessions' is set to the number of work sessions before a long break. In this code, it's set to 4.

When you run this code, you can click the "Start Pomodoro" button to begin a Pomodoro session, and the timer label will display the countdown. You can also click the "Stop Pomodoro" button to stop the timer. The timer follows the Pomodoro Technique's structure with work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
